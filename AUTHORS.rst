This library is an implementation and extension of the flood-filling network
algorithm first described in [Januszewski2016]_ and network architecture in
[He2016]_.

This library is built on the wonderful
`Keras library <https://github.com/fchollet/keras>`_ by François Chollet and
`TensorFlow <https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow>`_.

Diluvian uses a packaging and build harness
`cookiecutter template <https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage>`_.
